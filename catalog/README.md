Item Catalog
============

In this project we developed an application that provides a list of items within
a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and
authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and
delete their own items.

1. Launch the vagrant virtual machine: go to the parent directory (where
   `Vagrantfile` resides) and run `vagrant up`.

2. Log into the virtual machine with `vagrant ssh`, and then go to
   `/vagrant/catalog/` directory.

3. Setup the database `python database_setup.py`.

4. Launch the web server `python application.py`.
